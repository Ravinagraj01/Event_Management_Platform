    EVENTS ||--o{ FEEDBACKS : "receives"

    ATTENDANCES ||--|| FEEDBACKS : "enables"

    COLLEGES {
        string id PK "UUID"
        string name "NOT NULL"
        datetime created_at "DEFAULT NOW"
    }

    STUDENTS {
        string id PK "UUID"
        string college_id FK "NOT NULL"
        string name "NOT NULL"
        string email "UNIQUE, NOT NULL"
        datetime created_at "DEFAULT NOW"
    }

    EVENTS {
        string id PK "UUID"
        string college_id FK "NOT NULL"
        string title "NOT NULL"
        text description
        string event_type "NOT NULL"
        datetime start_time "NOT NULL"
        datetime end_time "NOT NULL"
        integer capacity "NOT NULL"
        string status "DEFAULT active"

    }

    FEEDBACKS {
        string id PK "UUID"
        string student_id FK "NOT NULL"
        string event_id FK "NOT NULL"
        integer rating "1-5, NOT NULL"
        text comment
        datetime submitted_at "DEFAULT NOW"
    }
```

### Key Constraints
- **Unique Constraints**: 
  - `(student_id, event_id)` in registrations, attendances, feedbacks
  - `email` in students table
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: All relationships properly enforced
- **Check Constraints**: Rating between 1-5, valid event status
- **Business Rules**: Registration → Attendance → Feedback workflow

## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints

#### Core Resources
```
POST   /api/colleges                    # Create college
GET    /api/colleges                    # List colleges

POST   /api/students                    # Create student
GET    /api/students                    # List students (with filters)

POST   /api/events                      # Create event
GET    /api/events                      # List events (with filters)
PUT    /api/events/{id}                 # Update event
DELETE /api/events/{id}                 # Cancel event
```

#### Event Interactions
```
POST   /api/events/{id}/register        # Register for event
POST   /api/events/{id}/attendance      # Mark attendance
POST   /api/events/{id}/feedback        # Submit feedback
```

#### Reporting
```
GET    /api/reports/event_popularity    # Event popularity report
GET    /api/reports/event/{id}/attendance # Event attendance details
GET    /api/reports/student/{id}        # Student participation summary
GET    /api/reports/top_active_students # Top active students
```

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "data": { ... },           // Success response
  "error": "message",        // Error response
  "timestamp": "ISO_DATE",   // Request timestamp
  "status": "success|error"  // Response status
}
```

## User Workflows

### Student Workflow
1. **Registration**: Student creates account or logs in
2. **Event Discovery**: Browse available events with filters
3. **Event Registration**: Register for interesting events
4. **Event Attendance**: Check-in at event venue
5. **Feedback Submission**: Rate and review attended events
6. **Profile Management**: View participation history

### Admin Workflow
1. **College Setup**: Create college profile
2. **Event Creation**: Create and manage events
3. **Event Monitoring**: Track registrations and attendance
4. **Report Generation**: Analyze event performance
5. **Student Management**: View student participation
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: Monitor overall metrics

### System Workflow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Student Login] --> B[Browse Events]
    B --> C[Register for Event]
    C --> D[Event Day - Check In]
    D --> E[Attend Event]
    E --> F[Submit Feedback]
    F --> G[View Profile/History]
    
    H[Admin Login] --> I[Create Event]
    I --> J[Monitor Registrations]
    J --> K[Event Day - Track Attendance]
    K --> L[Collect Feedback]
    L --> M[Generate Reports]
    
    C --> N[Registration Validation]
    N --> O{Capacity Available?}
    O -->|Yes| P[Confirm Registration]
    O -->|No| Q[Add to Waitlist]
    
    D --> R[Attendance Validation]
    R --> S{Registered?}
    S -->|Yes| T[Mark Present]
    S -->|No| U[Registration Required]
```

## Business Rules

### Registration Rules
- Students must be registered before attending
- No duplicate registrations allowed
- Event capacity limits enforced
- Registration deadline enforcement (optional)

### Attendance Rules
- Only registered students can mark attendance
- One attendance record per student per event
- Multiple check-in methods supported (manual, QR, mobile)

### Feedback Rules
- Only students who attended can submit feedback
- Rating must be between 1-5
- One feedback per student per event
- Comments are optional

### Data Integrity Rules
- All foreign key relationships enforced
- Cascade deletes for dependent records
- Audit trail for critical operations
- Data validation at API and database levels

## Scalability Considerations

### Database Scaling
```sql
-- Horizontal partitioning by college_id
CREATE TABLE events_college_1 PARTITION OF events 
FOR VALUES IN ('college-uuid-1');

-- Indexing strategy
CREATE INDEX idx_events_college_type ON events(college_id, event_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_registrations_student ON registrations(student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_attendances_event_date ON attendances(event_id, checked_in_at);
```

### Application Scaling
- **Microservices**: Split into event, user, and reporting services
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple Flask instances behind nginx
- **CDN**: Static assets and images
- **Database**: Read replicas for reporting queries

### Performance Optimizations
- **Query Optimization**: Proper indexing and query planning
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connection management
- **Async Processing**: Background jobs for reports
- **Data Archiving**: Move old events to archive tables

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Role-based access control (Student, Admin, Super Admin)
- Session management and timeout
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection in frontend
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Privacy Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU students
- Data retention policies
- User consent management
- Right to be forgotten implementation

## Conclusion

This design provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable campus event management platform. The modular architecture allows for incremental development and easy extension of features. The comprehensive API design ensures flexibility for various client applications, while the robust database design maintains data integrity and supports complex reporting requirements.

The system is designed to handle the specified scale (50 colleges, 500 students per college, 1000+ events) while providing room for significant growth. The technology choices balance development speed with long-term maintainability and performance requirements.
